# 2048 Game
2048 is a single-player puzzle game played on a 4x4 grid. The game starts with two numbers, either 2 or 4, placed randomly on the grid. Players shift all numbers on the grid in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right.

Shift Example: 
    A row with [2, 2, 4] shifted left becomes [4, 4, 0, 0].
  
Merging: When two identical numbers collide, they merge into one cell with their sum.
After each shift, a new number (2 or 4) appears in a random empty cell. 

The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048. The game ends when no moves are possible. The player's score increases with each merge, and the challenge is to reach 2048 with the lowest score.
